# Climate_bet : Project Overview
## Background: 
Many believe that climate change is one of the biggest threats to humanity and that massive changes
must be made in how we live to revert it and reduce its impact. 

Simultaneously, there are also many
skeptics, who either do not believe in the threat or do not
see a need to do much about it.

A fascinating statistical debate between the supporters and skeptics of global warming is the so-called
"Climate Bet" (http://www.theclimatebet.com/). The bet's nature is that Mr. Armstrong, a
statistician, claims that the model predicting a constant temperature will be more accurate than the
model that predicts warming. The 10-year bet was offered in 2007 by Mr. Armstrong to Mr. Gore, a
global warming advocate, who declined.

I dived into this debate and looked at the statistical evidence for global warming â€“ a primarily scientific, fact-based
view on the situation.
